# AI-Research-Agent
This project is an interactive AI research assistant built using LangChain, Streamlit, Tavily, and OpenAI. It allows you to query research topics, and the agent will use web search tools and an LLM to generate insightful responses.
Using the Agent
Type your question in the input box (e.g., "Recent advancements in image restoration").

The agent uses Tavily search to fetch real-time information.

An LLM (OpenAI GPT-3.5) processes the data and responds with a comprehensive answer.
